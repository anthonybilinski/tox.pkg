Description: Command line interface for SQLCipher
 SQLCipher is a C library that implements an encryption in the SQLite 3
 database engine.  Programs that link with the SQLCipher library can have SQL
 database access without running a separate RDBMS process.  It allows one to
 have per-database or page-by-page encryption using AES-256 from OpenSSL.
